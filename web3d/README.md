# Feather & Field in 3D, in the browser (started 20 October 2026)

Audrey chose (20 Oct) to build the 3D version into the web game instead of Unity, so Claude can run, test and fix it on its own
(headless Chromium draws 3D here in software) and she previews at milestones. Plan: (1) the village in 3D, (2) coops and birds,
(3) a living farm, (4) into the game, then the App Store wrap (Capacitor).

## Step 1: the village (done 20 Oct)

- `src/main.js`: the whole village in 3D, same layout as the 2D map: paths and streams as ribbons, the pond, the farmhouse, egg
  stall, pasture, woods, orchard, decorations, fields, bridges and dock, 40 plots (coops, empty plots, plots for sale), grass and
  flowers. The Unity farm's camera (orthographic, 42° down, 45° round), warm sun and sky light. Birds per coop potter about and keep
  their distance (a port of HenWander); only coops in view are animated. Drag / pinch / scroll, tap a bird for her name.
  `?coops=N` (0-40, default 2) fills that many plots with coops (40 is the stress test).
- Wheat: golden instanced stalks with ears on the wheat field (growing stages come in step 3).
- `src/farm_single.js`: the earlier single-farm test (not built any more, kept for reference).
- Performance on phones: lighter models (hen 3000 triangles, rooster 3400, chick 1500, coop 21k); static parts batched in
  12 m tiles (grass in 6 m tiles, hidden when zoomed far out); every bird's soft round shadow in one batch; shadows drawn only
  round the view and redrawn when the view moves; at most 2x pixel ratio; 30 fps when idle, 60 while touched; quality steps down
  by itself when frames come late. `?q=0..3` fixes the quality, `?details` shows triangles and draws.
  Measured at phone size: 80-200k triangles and 50-85 draws in normal views; 370k / 130 draws with 40 coops in view.
- `models/`: `village.glb` from `stylized/export_village.py` (the 2D map's Blender builders drawn in flat colours, via
  `stylized/webglb.py`); `village.json` from `stylized/village_layout.py`; `farm.glb` and `birds.glb` from
  `stylized/export_web.py`; `layout.json` (the pen) from `stylized/web_layout.py`. glTF axes: three.js (x, y, z) = Blender
  (x, z, -y); birds face +z.
- Build: `npm install three@0.170.0 esbuild@0.24.0` then `./build.sh` (writes `dist/`).
- Tests (serve `dist/` on port 8770): `shot.mjs` (screenshot at 402x874), `interact.mjs` (tap, drag, scroll, pinch, zoom limits,
  quality steps, birds moving, no page errors), `overlap.mjs` (birds keep apart), `census.mjs` (triangles per object),
  `tour.mjs` and `tour2.mjs` (screenshots and costs round the village; tour2 with 40 coops), `close.mjs` (hens at full zoom).
- Live: the game's site, folder `3d/` (https://kavaliere11-laudun.github.io/feather-and-field/3d/). The game's normal deploy wipes the
  repo, so it must copy `web3d/dist/.` into `3d/` too until the 3D village becomes part of the game itself.
